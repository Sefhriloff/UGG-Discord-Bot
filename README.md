Hello everyone, I created a Discord bot that can retrieve rune data from "u.gg" and display it as an image on your Discord server.

I'm new at coding in C#, so expect bugs and feel free to improve my code.

Remember you need to have all /files/ in your App Folder and configure the config.ini with your Discord bot token.
